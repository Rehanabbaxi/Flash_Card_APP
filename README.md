# Flash Card App 🇫🇷

A French-English vocabulary learning application built with Python and Tkinter that helps users learn French words through interactive flashcards.

## Features

- **Interactive Flashcards**: Display French words on the front and English translations on the back
- **Auto-flip Mechanism**: Cards automatically flip after 3 seconds to reveal the translation
- **Progress Tracking**: Tracks which words you've learned and removes them from future sessions
- **Visual Interface**: Clean, user-friendly GUI with card-like design
- **Persistent Learning**: Saves your progress between sessions

## How It Works

1. **Card Display**: A French word appears on the front of the card
2. **Auto-flip**: After 3 seconds, the card automatically flips to show the English translation
3. **User Response**: 
   - Click the ✅ (green checkmark) if you knew the word
   - Click the ❌ (red X) if you didn't know the word
4. **Progress Tracking**: Known words are removed from future learning sessions
5. **Next Card**: A new random card is displayed
